# Araco-Hexapod
Araco is a robotics passion project started in late 2022 and currently on its third generation. This repo is mainly to document the very whole process of building this hexapod, including designing, 3d-printing, coding, hardware, and further intergration with depth vision, SLAM, Nav2 and potentially reinforcement learning using Isaac Lab. Araco is built upon ROS2. 

The ROS2 package (the code), STL files, Isaac Sim stage will only be released when this generation is consider completed, however, I belive this documentation will be sufficient for anyone to build their own hexapod from scratch.
